# About

The JavaScript/TypeScript developer.   
Currently coding with React, Vue, Next.js, Nuxt.js and Electron.

This repository is a collection of libraries I found useful during my work.

## Repository Types

### Database, or data storage

#### [klaf](https://github.com/izure1/klaf)

klaf.js is a lightweight JavaScript library offering both a key-value store and document-oriented database with asynchronous operations. Optimized for performance and flexibility, it is ideal for modern applications requiring fast, schema-defined data storage.

#### [serializable-bptree](https://github.com/izure1/serializable-bptree)

This is a B+tree that's totally okay with duplicate values. If you need to keep track of the B+ tree's state, don't just leave it in memory - make sure you store it down.

#### [cache-entanglement](https://github.com/izure1/cache-entanglement)

Manage caches that are dependent on each other efficiently.

### Enhance flexibility

#### [ryoiki](https://github.com/izure1/ryoiki)

A range-based locking library for JavaScript, enabling concurrent read locks and exclusive write locks with seamless management of overlapping ranges.
